            Scio Code is a platform for me as a developer to have some fun with modern web technologies. Scio is written entirely in VueJS with a multitude of backend services to support it. The point of this project is for me to have an open playground to try new technology and share it with the world! This entire project is public on my GitHub for you to check out!
            On each page, you'll see links to my GitHub for their backend functionality. On this card, you'll find a link to the GitHub repository for the entire front end!

            Hi! My name's Erik Abramczyk. I've been a Software Developer since I was 15. Now, after college and starting in the industry, I've become a Full-Stack Web Developer on multiple applications, leveraging architectures from monolithic to entirely serverless.
